## Problem
Build a simple working web application using any nodeJS MVC framework, implementing following features:
1. oAuth authentication strategy for authenticating user using twitter
2. Implement Twitterâ€™s REST API twitter to fetch latest tweets
3. Display response from above API in a simple interface. We are expecting some interactions with UI such as filtering or sorting by dates.
4. Store/ log all authentications and API requests in RDMS database (preferably mysql / mongo)
5. These features must be extendable / reusable so that in future we can reuse these code to support other social media applications

### Optional
6. If possible, you can Dockerize this project
7. If possible, you can use a frontend technology such as Angular or React for your UI. 

Points 6 and 7 are optional but score bonus points if completed!  This test is to gauge your capability on your coding skills and including but not limiting to, code architecture, coding standards, use of design patterns on problem solving.
